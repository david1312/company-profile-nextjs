# My Next.js Playground

This is my playground for learning [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I'm using this project to experiment with various features and capabilities of Next.js.

### Personal Project:

In addition to learning Next.js, this repository also serves as the foundation for a personal project where I'm being a good brother by helping my sibling create a prototype web company profile based on a crypto miner company theme.

### Hosting Information:

This web application is hosted on cPanel at [bitboltz.co.id]

### Planned Improvements:

When I have free time, I plan to implement the following improvements:

- **Image Optimization**: Use `next/image` for optimizing images to improve performance (also considering migrate jpg/png into webp).
- **Skeleton Loader**: Add a skeleton loader to enhance the user experience during data loading.
- **i18n Support**: Implement internationalization (i18n) for English and Indonesian languages.
- **State Management**: Use XState or Redux for saving the language state and managing the scraping daily task.
- **Bitcoin Price Scraping**: Implement scraping for the latest Bitcoin information to display on the top bar.
- **E2E Testing**: Set up and run end-to-end (E2E) tests using Cypress to ensure the application works as expected.
- **Etc.**: Additional features and improvements will be added over time.

If you have any suggestions, feedback, or issues, feel free to add them in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/david1312/company-profile-nextjs/issues). If you're interested in contributing, you can email me at [davidbernadi13@gmail.com](mailto:davidbernadi13@gmail.com) to request access.

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
